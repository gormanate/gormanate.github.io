Here are a couple of projects I have worked on. I am proud of most of them.

### Twitter Bots ###
* [Wise Wrestlers](https://twitter.com/wisewrestlers) - Falsely attributes inspirational quotes to professional wrestlers.
* [Antique Appraisals](https://twitter.com/RoadshowAnswers) - Lots of people post to the Antiques Roadshow Facebook Page, asking for people to weigh in on how much one of their antiques are, and what those items might be. This bot generated a random description and made up a cost for the item. - This bot is not in service at the moment.

### Video Games ###
* [Nurse's Dilemma](http://www.errordiary.org/?page_id=9031) - This was a really fun project. When I studied in London for a semester, I entered a game design competition. As stated on [errordiary.org](http://www.errordiary.org/), "Over two months, teams were challenged to create a persuasive game that would get people reflecting on the causes of human error and raise awareness of blame culture within a healthcare context." I worked with [Adam Afghan](https://twitter.com/AdamAfghan), [Natasha Trotman](https://twitter.com/AdamAfghan), and [Jining (Kea) Zhang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jiningzhang/?ppe=1) on this project. We ended up winning first place! It was really fun to work on this, and I'm proud of the work we did.
* The other game I've worked on was a puzzle game. This was for a video game design class in undergrad.
