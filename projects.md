Here are a couple of projects I have worked on. I am proud of most of them.

### Twitter Bots ###
* [Wise Wrestlers](https://twitter.com/wisewrestlers) - Falsely attributes inspirational quotes to professional wrestlers.
* [Antique Questions](https://twitter.com/RoadshowFans) - Mirrors the wall posts made to the [Antiques Roadshow Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/RoadshowPBS/). Inspiration came from my roommate, Jonathan Karp.

### Video Games ###
* [Nurse's Dilemma](http://www.errordiary.org/?page_id=9031) - This was a really fun project. When I studied in London for a semester, I entered a game design competition. As stated on [errordiary.org](http://www.errordiary.org/), "Over two months, teams were challenged to create a persuasive game that would get people reflecting on the causes of human error and raise awareness of blame culture within a healthcare context." I worked with [Adam Afghan](https://twitter.com/AdamAfghan), [Natasha Trotman](https://twitter.com/AdamAfghan), and [Jining (Kea) Zhang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jiningzhang/?ppe=1) on this project. We ended up winning first place! It was really fun to work on this, and I'm proud of the work we did.
* The other game I've worked on was a puzzle game. This was for a video game design class in undergrad.
