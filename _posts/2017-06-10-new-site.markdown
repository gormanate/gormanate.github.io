I've done a little house cleaning in the last six months!

I got annoyed and frustrated with the amount of time I had to spend mantaining my wordpress site, and moved it over to jekyll after much procrastination. As you can see it's pretty bare bones at the moment. I like it that way, and it serves the purposes of what I want to do with this website for the time being. Now that it should be much less burdensome to maintain this site, I hope to write a little more, and hopefully have some more projects to share before the end of this year! I'm still not one-hundred percent certain what I'm going to do with this site (I'd like to write about hikes/bikes/fun things that I do), but now I have a presence on the web that I'm 2% happier with than the version that I had before! Enjoy!
